# Projecting Street-Level Images onto 3D Building Models using Raycasting

## About This Repository

Dear User,

This repository serves as a **proof of concept** for projecting street-level images onto 3D building models using raycasting. Some steps in this process were implemented using **FME**.

For scraping **Mapillary** data as open-source imagery, please refer to the following research paper: [IEEE Research Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10148212). The author provides a detailed explanation of how to extract images along with their corresponding JSON files.

**Important:** Please note that this project was developed as part of **research** and is **not intended for production use**. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to contact me or leave a comment.

## Requirements

To run `main.py`, ensure that you have a **virtual environment** set up with the following Python packages installed:

- `Open3D`
- `Matplotlib`
- `Scipy`
- `Numpy`
- `Pyproj`

### Installation Tip

Use the following command to install the required packages:

```bash
pip install package-name
